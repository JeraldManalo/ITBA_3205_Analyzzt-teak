## Methods

The researchers will use a Causal Analysis to achieve their goals. A Causal Analysis looks at the cause and effect of relationships between variables, with a focus on finding the cause of a correlation. To find the cause, you must question whether the observed correlations driving your conclusion are valid, as simply looking at the data surface won't help you discover the hidden mechanisms underlying the correlations. The observed relationships are simply average effects of the entire population in this research, which are studied in aggregate by many groups meaning the results might not apply to everyone.

2. Customers should be aware that if they are consistent, they will receive a discount.
